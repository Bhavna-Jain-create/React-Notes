React.createElement => Object => when we render this element on to DOM. It becomes an HTML. => HTMLElement(render)
JSX:- 
* JSX is a Javascript Syntax which is easier to create a React Element.
* JSX is not part of React.
* JSX is not HTML in Javascript.JSX is a HTML-Like and XML-Like syntax.
* JSX makes our developer life easier.
* JSX is convention where we merge HTML amd Js file.
* React.createElemet("h1",{},"Namaste React") ==  <h1>Namaste React</h1>

** Note:- When you write JSX, this code developed by us.Even before this code goes to the JSX Engine.It is transpiled before it goes to the JS engine.JS Recieves this code that browser can understand. **

** Transpiled means that converted to the code that browser / React can understand. **
* JSX - (transpiled before it reaches the JS Engine.) -> PARCEL -> BABEL(Babel is converted this code quickly that react will understand).

JSX => React.createElement => Object => HTMLElement(render).

** Note:- If you have to give attribute to JSX. you have to use camelcase. **
